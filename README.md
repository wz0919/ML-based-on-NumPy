# ML-based-on-NumPy
My implementation of classical machine learning algorithms based on NumPy.

- All algorithms are written in class. Mostly imitate the class form in sklearn and torch.
- Get rid of loops. All implementation are vectorized as possible.
- Implement advanced optimizing/initializing methods in most algorithms to make them faster.
